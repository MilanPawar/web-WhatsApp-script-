Choosing  a Framework: Decide whether you want to build a web application or a desktop application. For a web application, you can use Flask or Django. For a desktop application, you can use frameworks like PyQt, Tkinter, or Kivy.

Setting  up the Environment: Install the necessary dependencies including Python, the chosen framework, Selenium, and any other required libraries.

Designing the User Interface (UI):

For a web application, design of  UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of your chosen framework (Flask or Django).
For a desktop application, design of   UI using the tools provided by the chosen framework (PyQt, Tkinter, Kivy, etc.).
Implement Backend Logic:

Defining routes (for web applications) or functions (for desktop applications) to handle user requests.
 Selenium to automate interactions with WhatsApp Web, similar to the script provided earlier.
Integrate Selenium with the Application:

Initializing  the Selenium WebDriver within your application.
Implement functions to perform actions like logging in, sending messages, etc., using Selenium WebDriver.
Test and Debug: Test your application thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during runtime.

Deploying the Application:

For a web application, we deploy it to a web server like Heroku, AWS, or any other hosting platform.
For a desktop application, we can package it using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze and distribute it to users.
